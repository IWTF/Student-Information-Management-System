# Student-Information-Management-System
It is the curriculum design of C++.It is just a simple Management-System,It incluses two modules,that is,the Administrator module and Student module.
  Of course,the Administrator has more rights such as modifying the information,adding student's information and so on.This module mainly includes five functions.You can in this moudule do some work including adding,deleting,modifying,searching,and modifying the Administrater's password.
  The student module is simple and crude.Its some functions are simple,because I am a little busy during that time and don't want to waste time to improve them.Oh,I still have some regrets now.
